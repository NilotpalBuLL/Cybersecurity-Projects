🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects
📌 Overview

This repository is a collection of Python-based cybersecurity projects developed for learning, research, and experimentation.
It serves as a personal archive of security-related tools covering areas like:

🔐 Cryptography (classical & modern encryption methods)

🎯 System Monitoring (keylogging, logging, tracking)

🛡️ Password Security (strength analysis, cracking simulations)

🖼️ Data Protection (file/image encryption)

⚙️ Other cybersecurity experiments added over time

This repo is not limited to a fixed number of projects — new tools and implementations will continuously be added as the collection grows.
🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

Provide hands-on practice in cybersecurity concepts.

Build a toolkit of Python security projects.

Help learners understand how security mechanisms work internally.

Serve as a portfolio of security projects for professional growth.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x – core language

Tkinter – GUI for some tools

PyCryptodome / hashlib / RSA – cryptography libraries

OS, sys, logging, threading – for monitoring & system-level tasks
